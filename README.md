Tetris
======

This is a tetris clone. I implemented it using c++ and sdl.<br/>
Feel free to use any part of my work.<br/>
The directory resources contains files used by the game. If you don't like<br/>
any of those, you can easily change them (I used very suggestive names).<br/>


How to install it
=================

First, your need to install:<br/>
g++ sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf sdl_mixer<br/>
For arch run:<br/>
```
sudo pacman -S g++ sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf sdl_mixer
```
For fedora run:<br/>
```
sudo yum install g++ sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf sdl_mixer
```
<br/>
Then change directory to tetris.<br/>
```
make
```

How to run it
=============

Change directory to tetris.
```
./tetris
```
