Feel free to modify these files as you wish. If you find any bug, please contact
me (I did my best to find all, but I may have missed some) by submitting an
issue at https://github.com/berendeanicolae/tetris/issues . Thank you!

In order to work, the program needs some files you can download from https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9bS4AoQCn4IYmxIQU16dnMyUU0/edit?usp=sharing .
These files must be located in a folder named resources and this folder and the 
executable must be in the same directory. You can use other files if you want to 
(but in that folder you can find what you can replace).
